Project: 2D Map Data Analysis

This project consists of a Python script that loads and displays data from a text file containing a 2D map. It uses the matplotlib library to generate a visual representation of the map.

This project is useful for analyzing and visualizing 2D map data obtained from various sources, such as scientific experiments, geospatial data, or any other data set that can be represented in a similar format.

How users can get started with the project
- Clone this repository to your local machine.
- Make sure you have Python and the Numpy and Matplotlib libraries installed on your system.
- Run the map_visualizer.py script.
- The script will automatically load the data file 20x20um40x40p_map3.txt (make sure it is in the correct location or provide the correct path).
- You will see a display of the 2D map in a pop-up window.
